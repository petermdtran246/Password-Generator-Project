# Password Generator Project
This is a simple Python program that generates passwords based on user preferences.

## Features
  - Generates passwords with letters, symbols, and numbers.
  - Allows users to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in the password.
  - Provides options for both easy and hard levels of password generation.

### Easy Level
In the easy level, the order of characters in the password is not randomized. For example, if you specify 4 letters, 2 symbols, and 2 numbers, the password will look like this: JduE&!91.

### Hard Level
In the hard level, the order of characters in the password is randomized. For example, if you specify 4 letters, 2 symbols, and 2 numbers, the password will look like this: g^2jk8&P.
